Business model
* NONE OF THAT F2P CRAP
* 

Design & gameplay
* compelling story (world is in peril, you must save it, gather a group)
* feel like tabletop rpg from the 80s
* challenging combat
* spells, magic
* various enemies
* party management (invite, ask to leave...)
* NPCs
* living & breathing world (people go about their chores etc)
* turn based?
* time of day
* multilevel world (mountains to dungeons)
* seamless (no separation between world and cities)

Tech
* 2D tile based (or maybe go "voxels"?)
* portable (osx, win, *nix?)
* C / C++
* OpenGL

Streaming
* world divided into cells, say 256x256
* each cell 
  * is 64x64 blocks (right now stored as a 64x64 png)
  * can have N layers (to be decided how this works)
  * has a unique id
* rendering
  * each cell rendered with one call
  * since we're top down, we should only see max 4 maps (we're at the corner of a map), most of the time just 1. Hence a simple cell based occlusion should be enough
* streaming
  * if each cell = 64x64 8-bit png
  * and we have 256x256=65k cells
  * then the texture data = 16 megs - could easily keep all of that in memory
  *
