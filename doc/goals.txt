Business model
* NONE OF THAT F2P CRAP
* 

Design & gameplay
* compelling story (world is in peril, you must save it, gather a group)
* feel like tabletop rpg from the 80s
* challenging combat
* spells, magic
* various enemies
* party management (invite, ask to leave...)
* NPCs
* living & breathing world (people go about their chores etc)
* turn based?


Tech
* 2D tile based (or maybe go "voxels"?)
* portable (osx, win, *nix?)
* C / C++
* OpenGL
